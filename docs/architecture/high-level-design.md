# High-Level System Architecture

## System Overview

The Virtual Machine System Management is a sophisticated system designed to provide robust virtual machine handling, CPU state management, and memory virtualization capabilities. This document outlines the high-level architecture and interactions between major components.

## Core Components

### 1. VM Handler (src/core/)

The VM Handler is the central component responsible for:
- Virtual Machine lifecycle management (creation, destruction, pause, resume)
- State transitions and event handling
- Resource allocation and deallocation
- VM configuration management

### 2. Memory Management System (src/memory/)

#### Extended Page Table (EPT)
- Implements hardware-assisted memory virtualization
- Manages guest physical address to host physical address translations
- Handles page faults and access permissions
- Optimizes memory access performance

#### KASLR Implementation
- Provides kernel address space layout randomization
- Enhances system security through address unpredictability
- Manages memory region randomization

### 3. CPU Management (src/cpu/)

#### CR0 Register Operations
- Controls processor operating modes and states
- Manages cache enablement and paging
- Handles protected mode transitions

### 4. Logging Infrastructure (src/logging/)

- Provides comprehensive system event logging
- Supports multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Enables runtime debugging and monitoring
- Implements log rotation and management

## Component Interactions

```
[VM Handler] <---> [Memory Management]
      ↑               |
      |               |
      ↓               ↓
[CPU Management] <---> [Logging System]
```

## Data Flow

1. VM Creation Flow:
   ```
   VM Handler -> Memory Management (allocate EPT)
               -> CPU Management (configure CR0)
               -> Logging System (record events)
   ```

2. Memory Access Flow:
   ```
   Guest Access -> EPT Translation -> Host Physical Memory
                -> KASLR Check -> Memory Access
   ```

## Security Architecture

- Hardware-assisted virtualization
- Memory isolation through EPT
- Address space randomization (KASLR)
- Privilege level separation
- Secure resource management

## Performance Considerations

1. Memory Management
   - EPT caching optimization
   - TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) management
   - Page table walk reduction

2. CPU Operations
   - Minimal context switching
   - Efficient CR0 register handling
   - Optimized state transitions

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error detection
- Graceful failure handling
- Error reporting through logging system
- Recovery mechanisms

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for:
- Additional virtualization features
- New security mechanisms
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities

## Dependencies

- Hardware virtualization support
- Operating system kernel interfaces
- Memory management hardware
